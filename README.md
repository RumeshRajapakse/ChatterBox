## SOFT40051: Advanced Software Engineering

## Challenge: Design and implement two chat applications (one in C++ and another in Java) using the client/server architecture. In this project, you will have to code in both C++ and Java to enable users to exchange messages between the java and C++ applicationüíª

### Introduction üìå
<p> As the group project of ‚ÄúAdvanced Software Engineering‚Äù module, we had to implement chat applications in two different programming languages. One is from Java and the other is from C++ using the client/server architecture. Users should be able to exchange the messages between C++ and java chat applications using socket programming and TCP protocols. In the JavaFX, chat application consists of two main components. One is the client application and another one is the server application. Message passing between personal contacts and group chats handle by the server application. To handle the client connections. The server application must run always in the background. The JavaFX chat application is waiting to connect with the C++ application by opening a different port number. Apart from the message passing, the chat application provides load offline messages, edit profile, history maintenance, emoji passing, and get online user facilities as well. In conclusion, this chat application worked without lagging, provides interactive user interfaces to the user and this application achieved a high accuracy level and acceptance rate at the end of the project duration. </p>

## How to test the application ü§î
<p> For now we have tested the application using manual testing and test source codes creation in java are still in progress. Therefore, to test the application refer the 10 test case scenarios in the attached pdf document. </p>
